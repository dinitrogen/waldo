# Waldo

A "Where's Waldo"-inspired hidden object game developed as part of the Odin Project curriculum.

## Live Demo

Hosted with Firebase
- https://waldo-db4e8.web.app/

## Directions

The goal of this game is to locate and identify all of the hidden objects. Click on the image to display a targeting box, then select the correct object from the dropdown menu. Find all of the objects to win!

Currently only a simple image and version of the game is available (proof of concept), but more updates are coming in the near future, including a timer and online leaderboard.

## Tools

- ReactJS (create-react-app)
- Firebase hosting
- Cloud Firestore for fetching object coordinates
